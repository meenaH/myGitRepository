Zuora Api

- create an API user account 
- avoid using it to log into the zuora UI


- Z provides two REST services (production & sandbox)
- example of a well formed REST url:
  https://api.zuora.com/rest/v1/transactions/payments/accounts/A00000001?pageSize=40
  
    base url : https://api.zuora.com/rest/v1/transactions/payments/accounts/
    resource & associated method  : rest/v1/transactions/payments/accounts
    path parameter :  A00000001 
    query parameter : pageSize=40
    
- Most of the data & parameters will be contained in the body of the http request in JSON format 




Responses and Errors
- success field (true/false)
- Example of error code & message: 

    {
      "code": 53100320,
      "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
    }

In this example error code:

The "5" means that this error is returned by the REST service.
The next five digits ("31003") identify the object and field associated with the error.
The last two digits ("20") indicate a specific type of error, usually explained in the message.
